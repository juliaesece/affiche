# Weekly poster maker

Greatly simplifies the process of making a weekly poster for l'Académie du Climat. It was coded to allow someone with absolutely no experience with graphic tools such as canva to make a poster, as the only necessary input are the events, and the code takes care of the layout almost all by itself.

To use :
1. Write title, if there is one.
2. Specify which days have events, and how many per event. The left box is for the total number of events, the right box is for how many of those will need a description. Submit.
3. Fill the information for each event and submit. Emojis are supported in the titles. If you make any mistakes, just correct it on the form and then click on "modifier". Bold is suported through use of asteriks.
4. Click on "Mise en page" for the layout. You can further personnalize it by clicking on "compact" for a more compact mode, or by clicking on the events and "Monter" et "Descendre" to change their order (this last feature has some known bugs). You can also toggle the background for the other model.
5. Finally, you can download the poster by clicking on "Télécharger en pdf", or by printing it as a pdf (only the poster will be printed). You will also have generated the facebook post.

The page looks like this:
